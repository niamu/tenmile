# Curated Quotes

Each should have:
- title: a name for the quoted content, not just the gmae
- file: link to quote .png served from our asset bucket (will be used as the screenshot as well as the playable link)
- comment: explain the quote, referencing what's importantly included/excluded

Because we are showing these in a carousel, we can have a pretty long list, but we want the items to be sorted so that the first 3 or so are sufficient to convey our message(s).

Our primary message: Quotes can enable several compelling use cases -- a new form of human communication.

Our secondary message: There's depth of skill to making a good quote / you have a lot of implicit control over what's included/excluded from the quote.

Meta:
- important to cover use cases (and hint at them in the comment text)
- not important to cover many game types/genres


### Tetris without Tetris

Taste the core gameplay of Tetris. You can clear a few lines at a time, but you can't have the satisfaction of completing a Tetris (clearing 4 lines at once) because that's not included in the quote.

### Alpha Metroid

Tune your technique in the first boss battle of Metroid II. You can beat the boss and refill your supplies, but you can't leave the room.


### (a third example, a significant quote from well-known story)

Supposedly this game has a good plot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages#Plot

The quote might store the moment were you take the final action that leads to a significant plot point cut scene.

### (additional example ideas)

- a quote witnessing correct execution of a test ROM (use case: demonstrating correct implementation of a technical design)
- a quote showing a creative game / tool like a paint program (use case: supporting a meme culture internal to a given game)
- a quote sharing complete playback of interesting music (use case: showing specific game content in context)

[*Infinity*](https://github.com/gb-archive/infinity-gbc) is a role-playing game primarily developed by [Affinix Software](https://infinity-gbc.org/index2.html) between the years 1999 and 2001 before being cancelled as industry trends shifted. [A new project by Incube8 Games] is attempting to resurrect this project. Playable quotes might be part of helping to preserve cancelled game efforts that weren't successful in their own time. As a somewhat large Game Boy Color game, this game yields quotes that are too big to encode in our current file format. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
