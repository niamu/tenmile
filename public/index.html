        <p>
          This project offers the ability to create and share
          <strong>playable quotes</strong> of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> games. A
          playable quote is a
          <a href="#durable" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="durable-ref"
            >durable</a
          >,

            aria-describedby="footnote-label"
            id="delimited-ref"
            >delimited</a

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
          Quotes can allow players to share exciting moments and play styles
          from their favorite games, they can allow game publishers to tease
          content available in full games, and they can allow critics and
          educators to make convincing comparisons within and across the many
          moments in past games. These examples quote Game Boy games to
          illustrate potential use cases for playable quotes. Everything needed
          to reproduce each quote is contained within the
          <code>.png</code> files seen here.

        <h2>What's in a Quote File?</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>.png</code> quote files used in this project also contain a
          <code>.zip</code> file. We chose PNG because it's a familiar file
          format that people already know is easy to share online.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ZIP inside of the PNG contains a copy of the original game's ROM
          image with almost all entries (except those needed to play the quote)
          masked out. It also contains a state snapshot from our
          specially-prepared Game Boy emulator along with a list of timed
          actions needed to (approximately) reproduce the recorded gameplay. The
          ZIP file is

          But how do we know just which parts of the game to slice out in order
          to make a playable quote? You can read all the details in our post

          If you happen to have access to the original game associated with a
          given playable quote, you can load/drop the <code>.gb</code>/<code
            >.gbc</code
          >
          onto the quote player to resume <i>unrestricted</i> play from the
          moment captured in the quote. From there, you can record and share new
          quotes. Use this feature to re-record improvements on the gameplay in
          the original quote, share your progress in the game with a friend, or
          requests someone else's help getting through a difficult part of a
          game that you both play.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>More platforms</strong>: We need help finding and modifying
            emulators for other game platforms. Can you help us get quotes for
            PC games working on top of the
            <a href="https://copy.sh/v86/">v86</a> emulator?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software organization</strong>: We need help refactoring the
            code of this prototype into a form that is easier to reuse. We want
            embedding quotes into a new webpage feel like using the existing
            HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Robust playback</strong>: We need help further modifying an
            open-source Game Boy emulator in order to perfectly reproduce
            recorded gameplay given only the state snapshot and the recorded
            input events.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Robust riffing</strong>: We need systems to help players
            avoid accidentally exceeding the bounds of the quote when they take
            control for themselves (e.g. lookaheads and/or an undo trails).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Funding</strong>: Want to see playable quotes built out for
            your platform/ecosystem? Want to see a prototype application of
            playable quotes for your market? Contact

            <b>Durable</b>: Unlike a page number that only works when you have

            transformative use of the original work), and it allows you to talk
            about specific moments rather than entire games (a audible reading
            of specific sentence versus the text of book containing it).
