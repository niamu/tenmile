        <h1>Playable Quotes for Game Boy</h1>
        <p>
          This project offers the ability to create and share
          <strong>playable quotes</strong> of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> games. A playable quote is a self-contained slice of an original creative work that points to a specific moment in the space of play along with a reference performance of how that moment can play out. The reader of a quote can replay their own variations on the quoted moment to see how the game responds.

        <p>
          For a deeper understanding of playable quotes (including the <a href="#properties" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="properties-ref">key properties</a> of being playable, partitioned, permanent, performative), check out our award-winning paper <a href="https://adamsmith.as/papers/fdg2023_tenmile.pdf">Playable Quotes for Game Boy Games</a>, presented at the 2023 Foundations of Digital Games Conference.

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
          Quotes can allow players to share exciting moments and play styles
          from their favorite games, they can allow game publishers to tease
          content available in full games, and they can allow critics and
          educators to make convincing comparisons within and across the many
          moments in past games. These examples quote Game Boy games to
          illustrate potential use cases for playable quotes. Everything needed
          to reproduce each quote is contained within the
          <code>.png</code> files seen here.

        <h2>What's in a Quote File?</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>.png</code> quote files used in this project also contain a
          <code>.zip</code> file. We chose PNG because it's a familiar file
          format that people already know is easy to share online.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ZIP inside of the PNG contains a copy of the original game's ROM
          image with almost all entries (except those needed to play the quote)
          masked out. It also contains a state snapshot from our
          specially-prepared Game Boy emulator along with a list of timed
          actions needed to (approximately) reproduce the recorded gameplay. The
          ZIP file is
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography"
            >steganographically</a
          >
          encoded in the least significant bits of the image pixel data (8 bits
          per pixel) so that it is difficult for the information about the ROM
          and savestate to become detached from the screenshot.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how do we know just which parts of the game to slice out in order
          to make a playable quote? You can read all the details in our post

          If you happen to have access to the original game associated with a
          given playable quote, you can load/drop the <code>.gb</code>/<code
            >.gbc</code
          >
          onto the quote player to resume <i>unrestricted</i> play from the
          moment captured in the quote. From there, you can record and share new
          quotes. Use this feature to re-record improvements on the gameplay in
          the original quote, share your progress in the game with a friend, or
          requests someone else's help getting through a difficult part of a
          game that you both play.

        <h2>Help Needed</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>More platforms</strong>: We need help finding and modifying
            emulators for other game platforms. Can you help us get quotes for
            PC games working on top of the
            <a href="https://copy.sh/v86/">v86</a> emulator?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software organization</strong>: We need help refactoring the
            code of this prototype into a form that is easier to reuse. We want
            embedding quotes into a new webpage feel like using the existing
            HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Robust playback</strong>: We need help further modifying an
            open-source Game Boy emulator in order to perfectly reproduce
            recorded gameplay given only the state snapshot and the recorded
            input events.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Robust riffing</strong>: We need systems to help players
            avoid accidentally exceeding the bounds of the quote when they take
            control for themselves (e.g. lookaheads and/or an undo trails).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Funding</strong>: Want to see playable quotes built out for
            your platform/ecosystem? Want to see a prototype application of
            playable quotes for your market? Contact

              <dt>Playable</dt>
              <dd>Unlike a textual review or video recording, playable quotes are directly playable. You can grab the controls and try out your own style of play.</dd>
              <dt>Partitioned</dt>
              <dd>Playable quotes include only a small and intentionally selected piece of the original game's code and data. This leads to small file sizes and avoids accidental conveyance of larger parts of the original work.</dd>
              <dt>Permanent</dt>
              <dd>A quote is still readable after the original work is lost (unlike a page number or web URL). Every piece of the original work needed to recreate the quoted moment is contained within the quote.</dd>
              <dt>Performative</dt>
              <dd>A playable quote also contains a recording of play over time, documenting a particular style of action relevant to the quoted moment. In some cases, the quoted performance may be far more interesting than the game in which the performance was captured.</dd>
