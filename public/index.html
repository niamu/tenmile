        <h1>Playable Quotes for Game Boy</h1>
        <p>
          This project offers the ability to create and share
          <strong>playable quotes</strong> of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> games. A
          playable quote is a
          <abbr
            title="everything needed to play the quote is embedded inside of it"
            >durable</abbr
          >,
          <abbr title="only what's necessary to replay the quote is included"
            >delimited</abbr
          >
          reference to a
          <abbr
            title="the quote captures a tiny piece of the possible space of interaction"
            >specific</abbr
          >
          moment in a game along with a reference
          <abbr
            title="without actively playing, you can still see what might happen"
            >recording</abbr
          >
          of how that moment can play out.

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
          Quotes can allow players to share exciting moments and play styles
          from their favorite games, they can allow game publishers to tease
          content available in full games, and they can allow critics and
          educators to make convincing comparisons within and across the many
          moments in past games. These examples use commercial Game Boy games to
          illustrate potential use cases for playable quotes. Everything needed
          to reproduce each quote is contained within the
          <code>.png</code> files seen here.

          To record a new quote, you need access to a full game (typically a
          <code>.gb</code> or <code>.gbc</code> file). Try playing these freely

                >
                is based on a mix of Jump'n'Run and Metroidvania style game
                elements. We used Tuff extensively during the development of
                this project. The precise timing needed for certain jumps in
                this game shows that we don't have perfectly precise replays
                yet.

        <h2>What's in a Quote File?</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>.png</code> quote files used in this project also contain a
          <code>.zip</code> file. The zip contains a copy of the original game's
          ROM image with almost all entries (except those needed to play the
          quote) replaced by zeros. It also contains a state snapshot from our
          specially-repared Game Boy emulator along with a list of timed actions
          needed to reproduce the recorded gameplay. The zip file is
          steganographically encoded in the least significant bits of the image
          pixel data (8 bits per pixel) so that it is difficult for the
          informaiton about the ROM and savestate to become detached from the
          screenshot.

        <h2>Help Needed</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Robust playback</strong>: We need help further modifying an
            open-source Game Boy emulator in order to perfectly reproduce
            recorded gameplay given only the state snapshot and the recorded
            input events.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>More platforms</strong>: We need help finding and modifying
            emulators for other game platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software organization</strong>: We need help refactoring the
            code of this prototype into a form that is easier to reuse. We want
            embedding quotes into a new webpage feel like using the existing
            HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.
