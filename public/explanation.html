          Playable Quotes for Game Boy
        </h1>
        <div id="explanation-overview" class="explanation">
          <p>
            In the same way that you can quote a book, or make a clip of a
            video, this web page demonstrates a method to play, create, and
            share small moments from any Game Boy game.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, try loading
            <a href="https://bonsaiden.github.io/Tuff.gb/">Tuff</a>
            using the
            <button
              class="example-game"
              onclick="dropGameByUrl('https://bonsaiden.github.io/Tuff.gb/roms/game.gb');"
            >
              Example game
            </button>
            button.
          </p>
          <p>
            Play Tuff for a bit, then try loading a quote of Tuff using the
            <button
              class="example-quote"
              onclick="dropQuoteByUrl('https://cdn.glitch.com/80f5a65b-f7e3-4b40-b639-8e2c014de0ca%2FTUFF-ca28-7fff56ec.png?v=1628024161680');"
            >
              Example quote
            </button>
            button.
          </p>
          <p>
            The example quote demonstrates a very small part of Tuff. Initally
            you will see a replay of the inputs used to create the quote and if
            you press the <tt>Take control</tt> button, you'll be able to play
            that quote yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            However! If you try doing anything that wasn't part of that Playable
            Quote, the quote will reset.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="explain-what-a-quote-is" class="explanation">
          <p>
            This is a Playable Quote. Right now you are watching the movements
            that were made when the quote was created. However, if you
            <b>press the <tt>Take control</tt> button</b>, you can play the game
            too. Since this is only a quote, the game will reset if you try to
            do something that wasn't done when the quote was made.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="explain-how-to-make-quotes" class="explanation">
          <p>
            <b>Making your own Playable Quote:</b> To make your own Playable
            Quote, use the <span class="icon-upload"></span> button to upload
            any Game Boy game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Play until you are ready to start you Playable Quote, then press the
            <tt>Record new quote</tt> button. Continue playing the game until
            you are ready to end your Playable Quote, then press the
            <tt>Stop recording</tt> button.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once that is done, an image will appear below the emulator. This is
            a Playable Quote which you can download
            <span class="icon-download"></span> and share
            <span class="icon-share"></span> as you like.
